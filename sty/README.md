Texas State Grad College Thesis Template
======
This LaTeX template is designed to make formatting your thesis very straightforward.
You can read the file *txstate-grad.pdf* for complete instructions. You may also need
to delve into the files themselves for more detailed assistance.

Special Considerations
------
This template borrows its basic structure from Andre Miede's *ClassicThesis*,
but probably 80-90 percent of his original beautiful design has been stripped away in favor
of meeting the style requirements. If this template does not meet your specific needs, consult
this original effort for ideas on how to modify this template to suit.
